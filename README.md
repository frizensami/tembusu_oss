# Tembusu Open-Source Software (Tembusu-OSS)

## Purpose
This repository documents open-source projects that were developed in Tembusu by current and ex-Tembusians alike. Some were developed specifically for Tembusu, and some were initially tested in Tembusu but are intended to reach a larger audience. We hope that this list inspires future generations of creators in Tembusu to continue developing exciting solutions for real-world problems, and eventually contribute to the open-source community. 

## How to use these projects
Some of these projects come with instructions on how to run them, but some may also be in the process of doing more complete documentation. Contact the creators directly if you need help! 

## Contributing to these projects
Unless otherwise specified, these projects are released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which gives you full access to do more or less anything you want with the code (modify, use, copy, distribute..).

## Adding to this list
1. If you know how to do it, please submit a Pull Request against this repository with your additions to `README.md`. For those who don't and want to participate in open-source in the future, learning how to do this will provide you with an invaluable skill!
2. Alternatively, you can raise an Issue in this repository, or contact me personally.
